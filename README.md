## 🌌 Game Story

In the year 2232, humanity flourished under the peaceful rule of the **Terra Union**, led by the visionary **President Astraea Lumina**. With global harmony, advanced technology, and the end of poverty and war, Earth had entered a new golden age.

But peace was short-lived.

Without warning, a mysterious alien race known as the **Xeridians** arrived, launching a devastating surprise attack on **Nexus-6** — Earth’s primary orbital station and a vital interplanetary hub. The defenses of Nexus-6 crumbled quickly, and soon Earth's major cities, including **New Eden**, fell under fire.

As the world plunged into chaos, President Lumina and global leaders struggled to respond. In the midst of panic, a last-ditch plan was born: the creation of **Arkaria** — a generation ship built to save the remnants of humanity.

Led by the fearless **Captain Hamu**, a tactician of unmatched skill, you must defend Nexus-6 and buy time for the Arkaria's launch by holding off wave after wave of Xeridian attackers.

Will you survive long enough to save humanity?
