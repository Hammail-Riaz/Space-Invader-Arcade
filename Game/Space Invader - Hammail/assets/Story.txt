In the year 2232, humanity had finally achieved true peace and harmony on the Earth under the unified government of the "Terra Union", led by the wise and visionary President Astraea Lumina. President Lumina had brought an end to wars, poverty, and hunger, and had ushered in a new era of technological advancement and cooperation.

On a fateful day in March without warning, an alien spacecraft appeared in orbit around earth the aliens who came to be known as the "Xeridians". "Xeridians" launched a supper attack on the orbit Earth space station, named as "Nexus - 6", a massive latform that served as a hub for interplanetary travel and commerce.

"Nexus - 6" was a caught off guard, and it defence were quickly overwhelmed. As the station burned. the Xeridians began to the rain down destruction on the Earth's major cities, including the sprawling metropolis of New Eden, the seat of the Terra Union Government.

Humanity was thrown into chaos. President Lumina and the Terra Union leaders scrambled to respond to the attack, but their efforts were disorganized and ineffective. As the Xeridians continued their relentless assault, a small group of scientists, enginners, and military personnel hatched a desperate plan to fight back. They proposed the creation of massive generation ship, capable of carrying humanity's last hope to safety.

The ship dubbed as "Arkaria" would be equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including advance propulsion systems, artificial gravity , and sophisticated life support systems. 
it would be crewed by a handpicked team experts, led by the fearless Captain "Hamu" , a renowned space commander with a unparralleled tactical genius.


The Xeridian attack would come in waves, each one more intense and challenging than the last.

Our goal is to stop them form destroying NEXUS-6 and stop them to go ahead toward earth.
